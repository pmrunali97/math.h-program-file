Project Description : Here I have tried to implement some of the functions in math.h header file like - 
                      1. mfabs funtion.
                      2. msqrt function.
                      3. mfmod function.
                      4. mpow function.
                      5. mround function.
                      6. mfloor function.
                      7. mceil function.
                      8. mexp2 function.
                      9. mldexp function.
                      10. mtrunc function.
                      And some are new self implemnted functions are also like -
                      1. mfact function.
                      2. pos_neg function.
                      3. max function.
                      4. min function.
                      5. msquare  function.
                      6. mcube function.
                      7. mpowl function.
                      This is a new math.h header file consisting of above functions.
